-- This project was a team effort and we achieved our goal by following a few principles. 

# Project Design Principles
"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

Welcome to our UI class project, where we adhere to fundamental design principles that guide our approach to creating an intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient user interface. Our design philosophy revolves around four core principles: Simplicity, Usability, Learnability, and Efficiency.

# Simplicity
In pursuit of perfection, we recognize the power of simplicity. Our design ethos revolves around distilling complexity into elegant simplicity. By eliminating unnecessary elements and features, we strive to create a visually pleasing and uncomplicated user interface that enhances user experience.

# Usability
Usability is at the heart of our design decisions. We aim to ensure that interacting with our project is a seamless and enjoyable experience for users. By prioritizing clarity and ease of use, we enhance the overall usability of the interface, making it accessible to a broad audience.

# Learnability
Learning should be an intuitive and engaging process. To achieve this, our design prioritizes learnability. We believe that a user-friendly interface should empower users to quickly understand and navigate the system. By removing unnecessary complexities, we facilitate a smoother learning curve for users of all levels.

# Efficiency
Efficiency is a key consideration in our design process. We understand that users value their time, and our design aims to streamline tasks and processes. By optimizing workflows and minimizing friction in interactions, we enhance the efficiency of our user interface.
